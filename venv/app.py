    ### EXAMPLE
    Look and feel

    ‚Ä£ Stick to two pages or less and a single-column
    ‚Ä£ Make it boring! Black-on-white text, no bold, good spacing, 10-12pt font size
    ‚Ä£ Have correct grammar and spelling
    
    üë§ Head
    
    ‚Ä£ Start with Name AND Title (or Role)
    ‚Ä£ Avoid unnecessary Personal Identifiable Information (PII) ‚áí no photo, no date of birth, no home address, no marital status, no number of kids
    ‚Ä£ Drop links that don‚Äôt help, such as an empty GitHub or personal site
    
    üîé Summary
    ‚Ä£ Make it easy to read with bullet points and specifics
    ‚Ä£ Remove generic terms like ‚Äúteam player‚Äù, ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù, or ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù
    
    üë©‚Äçüíª Experience
    
    ‚Ä£ Try to make it start toward the top of the first page
    ‚Ä£ Show it In descending order without loops and with consistent date formats: ‚ÄùMonth YYYY‚Äù is best
    ‚Ä£ Make each bullet point tell a story: a challenge, your work, the outcomes, and using active language (‚Äùcompleted‚Äù is good, ‚Äúcontributed‚Äù less so)
    ‚Ä£ Spell out acronyms unless you are sure they are well-known
    ‚Ä£ Beware of grandiose words that AI generates, like Revolutionized and Spearheaded, for example, as they are, well, artificial
    ‚Ä£ Favor recent information only (no more than 10-15 years) unless you are sure it gives you an advantage to go farther back
    
    ü§π Skills
    
    ‚Ä£ Ignore skills and certifications that won‚Äôt get you hired, such as MS Office, git, Jira, Slack, MS Teams, or Miro
    ‚Ä£ Ensure as much as possible that the skills needed for the job, as per the job description, match the skills in your resume
